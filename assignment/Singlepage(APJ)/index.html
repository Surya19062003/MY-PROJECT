          <div class="intro">
            <h3 class="center">Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>APJ Abdul Kalam</b>, full name Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
              was an Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11<sup>th</sup>
              <b>President</b> of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on <sup>October 15, 1931</sup>,
              in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and passed away on <sup>July 27, 2015</sup>. Dr. Kalam
              was a renowned aerospace engineer and played a key role in India's
              civilian space program and military missile development. He was often
              referred to as the "People's President" due to his affable and
              accessible nature. Before his presidency, Kalam worked with India's
              space research organization, ISRO, and the Defense Research and
              <b>Development Organisation (DRDO)</b>. He was a strong advocate for
              education, particularly in the fields of science and technology, and
              often interacted with students to inspire and motivate them. Dr. Kalam
              was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
              <b>India's highest civilian honor</b>, and he remains an inspirational figure
              for his contributions to science, education, and national development.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;From <sup>1992 to 1997</sup> Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense
              minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser
              (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His
              prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified
              India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
              although the tests caused great concern in the international
              community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called
              Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for
              transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20
              years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing
              agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
              economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 India’s ruling <b>National Democratic Alliance (NDA)</b> put forward
              Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam
              was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he
              was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the
              main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his
              candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s
              11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left
              office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha
              Patil, the country’s first woman president. Upon returning to civilian
              life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to
              transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at
              several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering
              a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was
              pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward. Kalam wrote
              several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999).
