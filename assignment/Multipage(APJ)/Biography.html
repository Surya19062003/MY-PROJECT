        <h3><u>Early Life:</u></h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his academic pursuits, APJ Abdul Kalam was
          deeply influenced by spiritual and ethical values. His father,
          Jainulabdeen, was not only a devout Muslim but also a person of great
          integrity and kindness. Kalam imbibed these values, and throughout his
          life, he remained committed to principles of honesty, humility, and
          selfless service. Kalam's journey into the field of aeronautics began
          with his admission to the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) in
          1955. He specialized in aeronautical engineering and, in 1960,
          graduated with honors. Following his graduation, Kalam joined the
          Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist.
          His initial years were dedicated to research on engine technologies
          for missiles. One of the key milestones in Kalam's career came in the
          1980s when he played a pivotal role in the development of India's
          indigenous satellite launch vehicle program. His leadership in the
          successful development of the SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) and the
          PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) significantly bolstered India's
          capabilities in space technology. Another significant chapter in
          Kalam's career unfolded during the 1990s when he led the development
          of the Agni and Prithvi missiles. These achievements earned him the
          nickname "Missile Man of India." His contributions to India's defense
          capabilities were widely acknowledged, and he became a respected
          figure in the scientific community. Apart from his scientific
          endeavors, Kalam was a passionate advocate for education. He believed
          that education was the key to unlocking the potential of individuals
          and the nation. Even during his presidency, he continued to engage
          with students and youth, inspiring them to pursue excellence in
          science and technology. Kalam's popularity extended beyond the
          scientific and academic realms. His simple lifestyle, accessible
          demeanor, and motivational speeches endeared him to people from all
          walks of life. After his term as the President of India, Kalam
          continued to be actively involved in educational and philanthropic
          activities until his passing in 2015. His legacy lives on, and he is
          remembered not only for his scientific contributions but also for
          being a role model and source of inspiration for generations.

          career milestones:
          <br> <br> <mark>1. Aeronautical Engineer (1958-1982):</mark> After
          completing his education at the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam
          joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a
          scientist in 1958. His early work focused on the development of
          indigenous guided missiles. Kalam played a crucial role in projects
          like the design and development of a hovercraft and the country's
          first indigenous satellite launch vehicle (SLV). 
          <br> <br><mark>2. Indian Space
          Research Organization (1969-1982):</mark> In 1969, Kalam moved to the
          Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), where he served as the
          project director for the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) that
          successfully deployed the Rohini satellite into space in 1980. This
          marked a significant milestone in India's space program. 
          <br><br>
          <mark>3.Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (1982-1999):</mark> Kalam
          returned to DRDO in 1982 to lead the Integrated Guided Missile
          Development Program (IGMDP). Under his leadership, India achieved
          major breakthroughs in missile technology, including the development
          of the Agni and Prithvi missiles. Kalam's expertise earned him the
          nickname "Missile Man of India."
          <br> <br><mark>4. Chief Scientific Adviser to the
          Prime Minister (1992-1999):</mark> Kalam served as the Chief Scientific
          Adviser to the Prime Minister of India and also as the Secretary of
          the Defense Research and Development Organization. During this period,
          India conducted its nuclear tests in Pokhran in 1998, which further
          established the country's capabilities in defense technology.
